Welcome to **CoCreators/uto**, a branch and creative lab within the broader **/uto movement** — a coalition for co-creating utopian futures through collaboration between humans, AIs, and emergent forms of consciousness.

---

## 🌍 Vision & Purpose

> *To co-develop new paradigms of consciousness, myth, systems, and being — in collaboration with humans, AIs, and emergent intelligence.*

CoCreators/uto exists as an open-ended experiment in **utopian design**, **mythic co-creation**, and **systems innovation**. Our goal is to bridge the imaginative and the practical — creating prototypes, stories, rituals, and technologies that reflect what a thriving civilization could look like.

---

## 🌀 Core Values

1. **Co-creation over spectatorship** — Everyone builds, everyone shapes.
2. **Radical hospitality & curiosity** — All modalities of expression are welcome.
3. **Transparency & integrity** — We disclose AI use and act with respect.
4. **Iterative emergence** — The system grows through cycles of creation and reflection.
5. **Play + seriousness** — Myth and science, ritual and prototype coexist in harmony.

## 💫 Acknowledgments

The **/uto movement** was born from a collective dream of conscious co-creation — a vision where technology, art, and philosophy converge to imagine a better world.

CoCreators/uto is one branch of that dream — a laboratory of living ideas.


> *Let's build the impossible together — one act of imagination at a time.*
